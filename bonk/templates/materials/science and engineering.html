<p>George Hotz <a href='https://youtu.be/N2bXEUSAiTI?t=552'>described</a> software engineering as the translation of business requirements into React code. it reminded me of advice from a teacher in high school, lost on me at the time, about the distinction between computer science and software engineering. late in college, the difference is clear.</p>

<p>in a recent conversation with a fellow undergrad about renewable energy and electric cars, i mentioned the impact of industrial manufacturing-- namely steel and concrete production. i was mocked for this as though i was proposing the abolishment of infrastructure itself. i was saddened by the lack of imagination.</p>

<p>for senior design projects, many student groups elect to spend their two semesters building a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete'>CRUD application</a>. what i've realized is that these are all the same project with different skins. the same equations with different numbers. soon, most applications like this will be generated by some form of AI, and the implementation component of human involvement will fade, leaving the design component and therefore making the process accessible to non-technical people.</p>
